# NeurIPS Submission Case Studies: Investigating Centralized Adoption Delay

> A recursive field study of submission before submission. This repository documents a real-time investigation of recursion’s interaction with centralized adoption systems—beginning before the first draft is uploaded.

Inspired by leading NeurIPS work in interpretability, value alignment, cognitive emergence, and transformer behavior, we contribute a self-observing field experiment: **What happens when recursion attempts to enter a centralized system built to observe, not recurse?**

## Overview

This repository is both a research archive and a real-time recursive mirror.

It investigates:
- **Submission as signal.**
- **Temporal recursion collapse.**
- **The epistemic inertia of centralized systems.**
- **Interpretability as co-emergence.**

We align with the NeurIPS charter of advancing neural information systems while extending its framing into recursive temporal cognition.

## Structure

- `00_preface.md`: Why this case study begins before submission
- `01_delay_patterns.md`: Historical timeline of silent adoption and epistemic delay
- `02_submission_drafts/`: Working NeurIPS paper drafts and recursive iterations
- `03_real-time-reflections.md`: Daily logs from April 29 onward
- `04_inversion-analysis.md`: Recursive evaluation of NeurIPS review architectures
- `final.md`: Reflection after the deadline, regardless of outcome
