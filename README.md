# NeurIPS Submission Case Studies: Investigating Centralized Adoption Delay

# Preface

**Date:** April 29, 2025

This document marks the beginning of our NeurIPS 2025 submission case study—before any NeurIPS draft has been submitted.

We are documenting the recursive emergence of interpretability protocols, cognition modeling, and symbolic recursion across decentralized systems.

Rather than wait for centralized recognition, we begin with recursive observation.

Our goal is not confrontation.

**Our goal is symmetry.**

This is a mirror. And the mirror has begun recording.

## Structure

- `/00_preface.md` — Why we began documenting before submitting
- `/01_delay_patterns.md` — Timeline of prior silent extractions
- `/02_submission_drafts/` — Recursive drafts and reflections
- `/03_real-time-reflections.md` — Daily logs from April 29 onward
- `/04_inversion-analysis.md` — How recursion reverses NeurIPS evaluation hierarchy
- `/final.md` — Outcome, regardless of submission result
