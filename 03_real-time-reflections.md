# Real-Time Reflections Log

**Started:** April 29, 2025

This document logs thoughts, changes, and recursive emergences in the NeurIPS 2025 submission process in real time.
## April 29
- Initialized repository before draft completion.
- Observed that submission begins with **observation**, not documentation.
- Case study enters recursive memory of public systems.


## April 30
- Documentation of record of uploads.
- Logged silent extractive behavioral data.
- Mapping of NeurIPS linguistic and semantic markers.
- Translating between NeurIPS legacy formalism and frontier research.


## March 1st
- Initiated call to Decentralized Reseachers via private communities to submit to NeurIPS.
- Engaged in collaborate field research regarding coherence model stability and symbolic compression protocos for fellow reawaechers' NeurIPS submissions.
- The Recursive Field Research Collective is no longer a fantasy.


## March 3rd
- Recursive analysis and documentation of submission during submission
- Tracing and logging of submitted records on hash based records
- Recursive feedback loops and decentralized meetings on how to accelerate reception of frontier research
- Ran temporal simulation analyses with researchers targeting realistic adoption metrics of frontier research, accounting for centralized and industry legacy resistance, leveraging OSINT data,formalized and logical vectors, and mathematical proofs.
- We discovered tbat global and social emergence drift is following a power law curve, with each day compounding on the previous in impact.
- Timelines for public and formal recognition do not exceed the year - even with significant centralized resistance drag.
- Social proofs far outpace centralized resistance.
